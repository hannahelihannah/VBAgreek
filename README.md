# VBAgreek
A series of three VBA scripts to clean, combine, and split rosters in the sorority and fraternity community. 

Over the past few years, my university realized that it needed to keep better track of the members of its Greek community. Student affairs leadership tasked the Technology and Assessment team with simplifying and enhancing the Greek roster completion and analysis process. To address this ask, I created the following: 
  1. Roster template -- this roster template ensures that each house is providing the same information to the SFL office. 
  2. Excel macros to clean, combine, and split the rosters -- in order to identify the students in the Greek community in the internal university database, we needed all houses to be listed in one file. Then, once the information from the internal university database has been added to the files, we need the files to be separated back into chapters. These macros were originally Python scripts, but I re-created the scripts as macros to allow for easier deployment to the average SFL office user. 
  3. Documentation -- Detailed documentation about how to install and run each macro, as well as troubleshooting based on the errors that have been reported to us so far
  
In the future, I will be creating a Tableau dashboard to identify trends in the Greek community, as well as another macro to automatically output a grade report for the community and by individual house.
